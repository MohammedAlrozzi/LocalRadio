LocalRadio does not use the MacPorts version of libshout.  Instead, a modified version of libshout is embedded in the LocalRadio.app bundle to support AAC is used in this project:
https://github.com/bgeiser/Icecast-libshout

Install MacPorts autoconf (and other required libraries, etc.)

Add Icecast M4 macros to the libshout m4 directory:
https://github.com/xiph/Icecast-m4

Add Icecast common files to src/common directory:
https://github.com/xiph/Icecast-common

run autogen.sh and configure in terminal before Xcode make

The produced library should be copied into the MacPorts Libraries directory, and added to Copy Libraries build phase

In the app bundle, the library should be at /Applications/LocalRadio.app/Contents/Frameworks/libshout.3.dylib
