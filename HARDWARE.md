## Hardware Requirements

The LocalRadio application is built for Mac OS X 10.11 or later.

An inexpensive "RTL-SDR" USB device with the Realtek RTL2832U chip and a suitable antenna are required.  A variety of those devices are available from Amazon and other online stores.

LocalRadio has been tested with the "RTL-SDR.com v3" device.  It is well-designed and supports all of the features of LocalRadio, including direct sampling "Q-branch" mode to receive AM and shortwave frequencies.  This device - and an excellent blog - are available at [https://rtl-sdr.com]().  

Other RTL-SDR devices have not been tested yet.  Unlike the RTL-SDR.com device, many other device brands will only operate on higher frequencies, which may be adequate for FM broadcasts, NOAA weather radio, aviation and public service bands.  It may be possible to modify those devices to receive lower frequencies.

To minimize electrical interference and improve radio reception, it may be helpful to use an "active USB" cable to allow the antenna and RTL-SDR device to be placed away from the computer.

**If you decide to use an outdoor antenna with RTL-SDR, be aware of the risk of damage to your equipment from lightning storms.  Disconnect the outdoor antenna from your computer during thunderstorms, or whenever it is not in use.  An indoor antenna is the safer option for a permanent antenna connection.**
