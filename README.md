LocalRadio is an experimental, GPL-2 licensed open-source application for listening to "software defined radio" on your Mac and mobile devices.  With an inexpensive RTL-SDR device plugged into the Mac's USB port, LocalRadio provides a casual listening experience for your favorite local FM broadcasts, free music, news, sports, weather, public safety and aviation scanner monitoring, and other radio sources.  

LocalRadio's easy-to-use web interface allows the radio to be shared from a Mac to iPhones, iPads, Android devices, and other PCs on your home network.  No additional software or hardware is required for sharing with mobile devices, simply use the built-in mobile web browser to connect to LocalRadio and tune to your favorite stations.  You can also listen to LocalRadio audio on your Apple TV and other AirPlay-compatible devices.


LocalRadio is intended for use as in-home entertainment, using a local area network with a private IP address.  It has not been tested with a public IP address, particularly for security testing, therefore it is not recommended for that purpose.  For simply listening to LocalRadio on the Mac with the RTL-SDR device plugged in, no network is required at all.
